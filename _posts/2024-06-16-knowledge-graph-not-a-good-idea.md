Knowledge Graphs organize knowledge as graphs. They have contributed to a domain of research in recent data science, machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP). This blog post presents some thoughts that I have on it.

## Why in the first place store knowledge

The mentions of knowledge graphs can be traced back to the early days of the development of the Seamntic Web, whose motivation was to organize web data in a machine-readable way that allows them to be shared and reused across application.
Nowadays, the idea of knowledge graphs is not confined to the domain of web data, but data of any kind.
Disregarding the type of data, I argue that building representations of knowledge is only meaningful if we consider retrieval as the goal of it.
The reason is simple: if I do not work in this study room, why bother tidying up the room?
Retrieval does not have to be ,  just a query like "does this concept exist in my " already serve to demonstrate .
That is, knowledge graphs should only serve to aid retrieval, and the representation itself is mostly an irrelevant by-product.

Without the downstream need of retrieval, it is knowledge needs not to be organized.

This is data integration the Web 2.0 and the Semantic Web way.

If we induce knowledge from text, information already available in text
If we manually construct knowledge, more meaningful

## Challenges

I do not wish to repeat the commonly known learnability problem of such a graph.
Instead, I argue that even if we have a learner that is powerful enough to consume input of the world knowledge and produce a knowledge graph, there are important aspects about the graph data structure that does not make it a good strucutre of knowledge representation.

## Words as nodes

### Polysemy
In general, nodes represent entities.
Polysemous words 
WordNet uses synsets to represent senses of words
Polsemous edge relation
Knowledge Graphs organizes knowledge as graphs.
I orgranize 
However specific we , there is a problem 

### Definiteness

Spacial-temporal





## Why Graph

<!-- Graphs provide neat representation of .
Imagine an edge that connects to more than two nodes. -->

### Why not graph?
