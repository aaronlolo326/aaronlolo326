Knowledge Graphs are graphs that describe relationships between entities.
It provides explicit modelling of "knowledge", as opposed, possibly useful for trasnfer
We 
Nevertheless, to my knowledge, it has not yet been used extensively, and in the large language models.
In this blog post, I do not wish to repeat the commonly known learnability problem of such a graph.
Instead, I argue that even if we have a learner that is powerful enough to consume input of the world knowledge and produce a knowledge graph, there are important aspects about the graph data structure that does not make it a good strucutre of knowledge representation.


## Words as nodes

### Polysemy
In general, nodes represent entities.
Polysemous words 
WordNet uses synsets to represent senses of words

### Definiteness

Spacial-temporal





## Why Graph

<!-- Graphs provide neat representation of .
Imagine an edge that connects to more than two nodes. -->

### Why not graph?
