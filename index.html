about_me: "I received both my PhD and B.Sc. at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). I am interested in computational semantics, with a particular research focus of developing computational methods that would expand the intersection of theory-centric formal semantics and data-driven statistcal semantics.
My PhD research studies sentence-level meaning representations through the lens of graph grammar and distributional semantics.</p>
