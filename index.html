about_me: "
<p>I received both my Ph.D. and B.Sc. at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). I am interested in computational semantics, the study of how meanings of natural languages can be represented and used via computational approaches.
During my Ph.D. studies, I developed computational methods that would expand the intersection of theory-centric formal semantics and data-driven statistcal semantics, where sentence-level meaning representations were stuided through the lens of graph grammar and distributional semantics.
